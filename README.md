# 🔐 Watermarking Analysis on Summarization Task

This project explores watermarking techniques in natural language processing, specifically applied to **text summarization**. The goal is to evaluate whether summaries generated by large language models can be traced or identified using watermarking strategies.

---

## 📌 Overview

The notebook (`watermarking_analysis_on_summarization_task.ipynb`) includes:

- A summarization pipeline using GPT models
- Application of watermarking techniques
- Evaluation metrics and comparison
- Visualizations of detection accuracy

---

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- T5 Small Model
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Custom watermarking logic
