# Watermarking Analysis on Summarization Task

This project explores watermarking techniques in natural language processing, specifically applied to **text summarization**. The goal is to evaluate whether summaries generated by large language models can be traced or identified using watermarking strategies.

## Overview

The notebook (`watermarking_analysis_on_summarization_task.ipynb`) includes:

- A summarization pipeline using GPT models
- Application of watermarking techniques
- Evaluation metrics and comparison
- Visualizations of detection accuracy

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- T5 Small Model
- NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
- Custom watermarking logic

## Running the Notebook

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/summarization-watermarking-analysis.git
   cd summarization-watermarking-analysis
   ```

2. (Optional) Set up a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Key Results

- Detection accuracy of watermarking vs. non-watermarked outputs
- Trade-offs between watermark robustness and output quality
- Limitations in low-resource summarization settings
